# ARDUINO_intelligent-irrigation-system
The object is to design an automatic irrigation system for the plants indoor. Our products are profitable to people who have the plants at home and are too busy to forget to take care of their plants.

Functionality for watering:

1.display the real temperature and humidity 
2.Water level detection for  alarm  of  water shortage.
3.Watering can be operated both manually (demonstrated by infrared control) and intelligently.
4.The data in real time can be remotely  viewed , the server store the data once a hour. Command watering can be remotely realized.
